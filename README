NEVADA The ARM-NEON Visualization Tool

SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instruction sets are getting more and
more widespread even in the embedded world as they offer increased computation
power. However, to efficiently use such instruction sets some experience is
needed. It is essential to try and observe the exact behaviour of small SIMD
code snippets to get that experience. Setting up the necessary environment can
be difficult, especially for newcomers, thus tools visualizing the execution of
such short snippets can greatly accelerate the learning phase.
   In cooperation with ARM we created a visualizing tool called NEVADA which
enables observing the execution of NEON instructions which is the SIMD extension
of the industry leading ARM architecture in the embedded domain. Since NEVADA
runs inside a web browser, anyone and anywhere can try NEON code without setting
up any environment.

NEVADA has the following key features:
 * Allows observation of NEON instruction sequences by interpreting them
   step-by-step or continuously.
 * The register and memory content can be displayed in various formats
   (decimal, hexadecimal or float) and data sizes.
 * The effect of the instructions on the registers are highlighted by
   colors for a better understanding
 * It can save and load the whole machine state. The state also can be
   encoded inside a URL. This feature is excellent for creating learning
   materials.

NEVADA is a free and open source tool, for more information about how to get
it, see https://github.com/loki04/nevada.
